### Medic Tent

#### jk_medicTent.sqf ([by jokoho48](https://github.com/jokoho48))
Adds a Medical Tent to vehicles which can be built and used as an ACE medical facility has to be torn down before it can be constructed again.
1. add vehicles to JK_Medical_Vehicles (```JK_Medical_Vehicles = [zamak_medic];```)

### placePlayableUnits.sqf
Places playable units in 3DEN Editor. Sets callsignes, frequencies and loadout variables.

### plane.sqf

MyPlane.init:
```
this addAction ["We are ready for take off.", {
    params ["_target", "_caller"];
    _target setVariable ["takeOffStarted", true, true];

Plane.init:
```
[this] call Spec_cargoDrop_fnc_addParaDropEvent;
```

### spec_checkpoint
Simple AI checkpoint script with smuggler (and intel) via ACE action.
* in Waypoint add to onAction: ```[this,"marker_target"] call Spec_checkpoint_fnc_addPassCheckAction;```
    * then vehicle and unit has ace action to pass the checkpoint and drives to given marker position
* in vehicle of smuggler add: ```[this call Spec_checkpoint_fnc_loadSmugglerItems;``` to load nearby items (see const.hpp) into ace cargo

* ```[truck,typeOf object, name of object, (number of animation),(number of objects)] call Spec_construct_fnc_objectAddConstructionStation;```
* ```[player,actionID, name of action, typeOf object, (number of animation)] call Spec_construct_fnc_playerAddConstructAction;```

### spec_crate
Template for ammo crates
* After mission start (fn_postInit.sqf) all available crates are searched for specific types and refilled (e.g. "TTT_Logistik_Medic_Bw" is filled with ACE medic content)
* Contains a crate filler

### spec_crateNaming
Adds ACE action to all crates to edit the display name in ACE cargo.
1. add "CfgFunctions.hpp" to "CfgFunctions" in description.ext

* place single civilian
    * in init field: ```this setVariable ["Spec_farming_marker", "marker_0"];```

### spec_fullheal
1. add action to assign vehicle to provide full heal

### spec_heli
two different upgrades of heli_evac.sqf which use a helicopter placed in the editor
1. Spec_heli_fnc_taxi (taxi.sqf) and Spec_heli_fnc_moveMarkerLZ (moveMarkerLZ.sqf)
    1. choose ace action to mark a LZ
    2. if player clicks on map a LZ marker will be placed (visible for everyone and unique name)
    3. if helicopter is called flies to marker position and flies off to base if no man nearby
2. Spec_heli_fnc_medEvac (medEvac.sqf) (Spec_heli_fnc_medEvacRetransfer heli_medevac_retransfer)

    3. unloaded passenger will be fully healed with a PAK (from ACE Advanced Medic)
    4. optional (heli_medevac_retransfer): ace action is to retransfer to last called LZ

initPlayerLocal.sqf:
```
private _actionMedevac = ["Spec_action_callMedevac", "Call MedEvac", "", {_this remoteExec ["Spec_fnc_heli_medevac",2]}, {true}] call ace_interact_menu_fnc_createAction;
[player,1, ["ACE_SelfActions"], _actionMedevac] call ace_interact_menu_fnc_addActionToObject;
[] call Spec_fnc_moveMarkerLZ;

* currently serverID is determined in a bad way (with sleep 20)
1. add functions via header-file in description.ext

### suicide.sqf
If conditions are met unit, vehicle or other attached object will trigger a explosion (with 3 possible sizes).

Trigger.OnActivation:

```

The (sever-only) trigger should be attached to bomberA (via initServer.sqf).
